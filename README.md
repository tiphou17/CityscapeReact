
# Welcome to our Cityscape Android App !

Cityscape is a school react native project about a real estate agency. We first made a web version with Symfony. Now we are working on the android app.


## Requirements

(we are working on this part)
## Getting started
Run the following command to start a development server

```
npx expo start
```

To run our application on your android phone you can download [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project.
